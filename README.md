# _FocusHereUi_

#### By **Aaron Brown**

#### A User Interface for the FocusHere API for tracking upcoming classes and focusing efforts for ADHD students and their families.

## Description
This user interface displays schedules, lessons and assignments for students of middle and high school.  It uses the API, whose repository is [here](https://github.com/aaronvbrown/FocusHereApi.Solution).

General statements like "Catch Up On Classwork" and "Get ready for class" can be overwhelming for students with ADHD.  This tool reduces those anxieties by showing only needed and impactful information about upcoming classes, including:
  * lessons (with links)
  * important assignments (with links)
  * important calendar dates

This API is intentionally separate from the User Interface so that it can be consumed by varying user interfaces, including web apps and browsers.  In the future, it may link directly to existing tools created by the student's school (Canvas, Jumprope, Etc.) in order to automate data population and feedback from educators. Information will be queried with multiple filters, including default filters based on the current date.
